# Suraci-etal-MammalLifeHistory
This repo containts all code necessary for reproducing the analyses in Suraci et al. "Disturbance type and species life history predict mammal responses to humans".  See below for a description of each file included here

# ANALYSIS SCRIPTS
_RunOccupancyModels.R_ - Prepares data and fits single species occupancy models (via call to Stan) to each species.  The modExtract function produces convenient lists of data sets from each fitted model object for use in further analyses and plotting.
_RunTraitModels.R_ - Prepares data and runs (1) mammal trait PCA and (2) mammal response vs. trait linear mixed effects models (via call to Stan). Requires first running single species occupancy models

# STAN PROGRAMS
_OccMod_BetaBinom.stan_ - Stan program fit single species, beta-binomial occupancy model including population- and camarea site-level random effects.  Called in "RunOccupancyModels.R" script.
_RunTraitModels.R_ - Stan program to fit mammal response vs. trait models (linear mixed effects models with observation error). Called in "RunTraitModels.R" script.

# HELPER FILES
_SpeciesModSettings.csv_ - Species-specific Stan model settings used in "RunOccupancyModels.R" script.
_SpeciesTraits.csv_ - Mammal species trait values used in fitting the trait PCA. Used in "RunTraitModels.R" script.
